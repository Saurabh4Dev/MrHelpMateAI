This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.

Any decrease in Scheduled Benefit amounts due to a request by the Member will be effective on the date of the change, whether or not the Member is Actively at Work. A change in the Scheduled Benefits because of a request by the Member when a change in family status has occurred for which Proof of Good Health is required (see e. above) will be effective on the later of: (1) the date the change would have been effective if Proof of Good Health had not been required; or (2) the date Proof of Good Health is approved by The Principal. Article 2 - Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance will be effective under the same terms as set forth for Member Life Insurance in this Section B, Article 1. However, in no event will Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. Any change in a Member's Scheduled Benefit will be as stated in this Section B, Article 1. Article 3 - Dependent Life Insurance Dependent Life Insurance is available only with respect to Dependents of Members currently insured for Member Life Insurance. If a Member is eligible for Dependent Life Insurance, such insurance will be effective under the same terms as set forth for Member Life Insurance in this Section B, Article 1, except as described below.

The Principal will make a full and fair review of the claim. The Principal may require additional information to make the review. The Principal will notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal request. If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension for the review. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. After exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal. However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \"claimant\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy. The Principal will pay for any such autopsy. Article 7 - Legal Action Legal action to recover benefits under this Group Policy may not be started earlier than 90 days after required proof of loss has been filed and before the appeal procedures have been exhausted. Further, no legal action may be started later than three years after that proof is required to be filed. Article 8 - Time Limits Any time limits in this section will be adjusted as required by law.

This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.

A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b. If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded on the date of termination. If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named.

If The Principal believes a person is not legally able to give a valid receipt, as determined by The Principal, for a payment, and no guardian has been appointed, The Principal may pay whoever has assumed the care and support of the person. Article 5 - Settlement of Proceeds When The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death, the Scheduled Benefit (or approved amount, if applicable) in force for the Member, less any Accelerated Benefit payment as described in PART IV, Section A, Article 7 will be placed in an interest-bearing draft account at an interest rate determined by The Principal, unless a lump sum or other settlement option has been elected. With the interest-bearing draft account, the balance will be available to the beneficiary at any time, in total or in part, subject to the following terms: a. withdrawals must be made by draft furnished by The Principal; and b. the draft amount must be at least $500 or more and may not exceed the account balance; and c. if the account balance falls below $500, the balance will be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum and the account closed; and d. the account cannot be assigned or used as collateral. The Interest Draft Account will not be available if the Scheduled Benefit amount payable is $5,000 or less; or if the beneficiary is anything other than a natural person. In these instances, a lump sum payment will be made.
